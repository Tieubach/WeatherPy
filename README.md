CONCLUSION
## PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN REQUEST TO GRAPH A VS B MEANS A IS Y-AXIS AND B IS X-AXIS (B)

1. Within +/- 20 degree of latitude from equator, the temperatures are in the range of 70 - 80 deg F (assume data collected is now - which is in summer time frame)
    
2. For cities further away from equator, the temperature is drop (cooler) compare near equator line

3. For Cloudiness, Wind speed, and Humidity, there are not enough data to make conclusion.  
    a.  There is no correlation.
    b. Still missing longitudinal coordinate data in order to compare.  
    c.  Meaning, whether those cities are located in tropical zone, desert area, ect..
